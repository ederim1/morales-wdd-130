    <p> Hey everybody!
        
        I am from Cruz Azul, Hidalgo, Mexico, and I love my cultre and my people. I am a little older than most of you, <br>
        I have a bachelors in business and logistics but I decided to study to change my field, now I am doing Software Engineering<br>
        and I enjoy playing with computers and learning about cybersecurity. </p>
        <p>
        Despite the fact that computers require to be inside of a building, an office or a data center, <br>
        I love outdors as well. I love nature and I enjoy fishing, camping, doing mountain biking,<br>
        I also love to travel and get to know my country and my culture as well as new cultures, <br>
        new places, new flavors, new music, etc.</p>
        <p>
        My wife and I have had the blessing to be able to travel and get to know many places together and I am grateful for that. <br>
        In the future I want to find a way to help people in poverty to get better oportunities, specially with education<br>
        I want to help kids and young people to find joy in learning about technology and open their eyes to new opportunities<br>
        and to find ways to improve their situation.
        

    </p>
