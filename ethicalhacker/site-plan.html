      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>You probably want to get into the world of hacking, even if you are only an apprentice yet. 
        You want to learn and want to know where to start. I want to help newbies to reach their full potential by letting them know the steps, 
        and the paths, and giving them some sites where they can get trained to become professionals. 
        I want the website to present paths and options for people who want to change their path or field, 
        get a better job, and get news and fresh info. The site will give them suggestions and articles to read and get started. </p>  <!-- change this -->
